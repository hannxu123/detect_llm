[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 450, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You will be given an essay prompt. Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes.

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks.

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared.

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It's not that a group of old guys doesn't know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park. They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. It didn't matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it really did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my sirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine.Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel.

The setting, which includes the terrain, weather, and availability of resources, ultimately affects the cyclist's physical and mental state.\n\nFirstly, the terrain of the setting directly impacts the cyclist's journey. In the beginning, the cyclist is optimistic and enjoys the serenity of an early-summer evening. However, as the journey progresses, the terrain becomes challenging and unforgiving. The flat road transforms into short, rolling hills, and eventually, a rough road warns against exceeding the speed limit. These physical obstacles drain the cyclist's energy and exacerbate the difficulties they face.\n\nAdditionally, the scarcity of necessary resources such as water amplifies the challenges faced by the cyclist. The old men's incorrect advice regarding the availability of towns leads the cyclist to rely on his water supply, which proves to be inadequate. As a result, the cyclist becomes dehydrated and desperate for water as he encounters non-functional water pumps and a lack of inhabited areas. The absence of water exacerbates the physical toll on the cyclist, increasing the risk of heatstroke and compromising their well-being.\n\nFurthermore, the desolate and abandoned surroundings have a psychological impact on the cyclist. The cyclist describes the once-thriving town turned into a ghost town as well as the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory. These desolate and hopeless sights contribute to the cyclist's feelings of despair and hopelessness. The lack of human presence and signs of life intensify the cyclist's isolation and vulnerability on their journey.\n\nOverall, the features of the setting have a profound impact on the cyclist's physical and mental well-being.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 450, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You will be given an essay prompt. Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Even if a dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would constantly rotate around it.

I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment.

The desolate and isolated surroundings contribute to his physical and mental struggles, ultimately influencing his decision-making and perception of the journey.\n\nOne example of how the setting affects the cyclist is the lack of water supply. The essay describes the cyclist's encounters with rusted water pumps and brackish water. The scarcity of clean and drinkable water heightens the cyclist's dehydration and adds to his physical strain. This is evident when the author states, \"The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my shirt.\" The harsh environment amplifies the cyclist's desperation and emphasizes the challenges he faces.\n\nAdditionally, the inhospitable terrain and treacherous road conditions also impact the cyclist. The essay mentions the warning sign for a rough road ahead, emphasizing the challenging nature of the cyclist's path. The author notes, \"The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph.\" The difficult terrain and the cyclist's slower pace due to fatigue exacerbate the physical exertion required for the journey. The oppressive surroundings present continuous obstacles, making the cyclist question his decision to follow the advice of the old men.\n\nMoreover, the absence of civilization and assistance showcases the isolation of the setting and its effects on the cyclist. The essay highlights the absence of buildings, cars, or any kind of structure. This isolation intensifies the cyclist's feelings of loneliness and vulnerability. The author expresses, \"There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind.\" This lack of human presence contributes to the cyclist's sense of despair and heightens his realization that he might not survive this journey.\n\nIn conclusion, the features of the setting, including the scarcity of water, challenging terrain, and isolation, greatly impact the cyclist's experience. These elements contribute to his physical exhaustion, mental strain, and feelings of vulnerability. The essay effectively portrays how the setting shapes the cyclist's journey and influences his decision-making process."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens": 420, "total_tokens": 1804}}]

It is crucial to recognize that the removal of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other form of artistic expression not only undermines the principles of intellectual freedom but also perpetuates a dangerous cycle of ignorance. This essay will argue against the practice of removing offensive materials from library shelves, emphasizing the importance of intellectual freedom, fostering critical thinking, and promoting open dialogue.\n\nBody:\n\n1. Intellectual Freedom:\nLibraries represent our society's commitment to intellectual freedom, providing spaces where individuals can access a vast range of information, ideas, and creative expressions. By removing materials based on subjective offense, we undermine the very essence of intellectual freedom, limiting individuals' exposure to diverse perspectives and stunting intellectual growth.\n\n2. Nurturing Critical Thinking:\nAllowing offensive materials to remain on library shelves offers an opportunity for individuals, particularly young minds, to develop critical thinking skills. Exposure to challenging or uncomfortable ideas invites readers and users to evaluate, question, and form their own balanced conclusions. Shielding individuals from offensive material denies them the chance to engage in this crucial introspective process, hindering their ability to think independently.\n\n3. Promoting Open Dialogue:\nRather than removing offensive materials, libraries should embrace them as catalysts for open dialogue and understanding. Encountering ideas that challenge our beliefs can lead to valuable conversations that promote empathy and tolerance. The censorship of offensive materials only reinforces existing biases and creates an echo chamber, shutting out diverse perspectives that society desperately needs to progress and grow.\n\n4. Parental Guidance and Responsibility:\nWhile it is important to address concerns regarding age-appropriate content, the responsibility to protect children from offensive materials primarily rests with parents and guardians. Libraries already incorporate various methods, such as rating systems or designated children's sections, to assist parents in making informed choices. Empowering parents to guide their children's reading choices respects their right to foster their child's values, while still preserving intellectual freedom for others.\n\n5.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

However, this perspective neglects the fundamental tenets of intellectual freedom and the role libraries play in promoting knowledge, personal growth, and diversity. Katherine Paterson aptly highlights the dilemma faced by advocates of censorship - by removing offensive works, we risk depriving ourselves of the diverse and profound literature that makes our libraries invaluable. This essay will argue that while some may find certain materials objectionable, it is essential to defend the freedom of expression and resist the impulse to censor materials in libraries.\n\nBody:\n\n1. Upholding the Freedom of Expression:\n\nThe freedom of expression, a bedrock of democratic societies, is safeguarded through the existence of libraries. Removing offensive materials infringes upon individuals' right to freely express and share ideas, thereby stifling creativity and hindering intellectual development. Libraries serve as institutions that facilitate interaction with a wide range of ideas, allowing individuals to explore diverse thoughts and experiences. By preserving a variety of viewpoints, even those that might be offensive, libraries create an environment that encourages critical thinking and fosters the growth of society as a whole.\n\n2. Empowering Critical Thinking and Personal Growth:\n\nExposure to diverse perspectives, even those that may initially be disagreeable, fosters critical thinking and personal growth. Literature acts as a mirror, allowing individuals to reflect upon their own beliefs, question societal norms, and broaden their understanding of the world. Removing offensive materials inhibits individuals from grappling with challenging ideas and hampers their ability to form their own informed opinions. Through access to diverse materials, libraries empower individuals to think independently and develop intellectual resilience.\n\n3. Safeguarding Against Unchecked Power:\n\nCensorship in libraries poses a significant risk of enabling an undue concentration of power. Granting certain individuals the authority to determine what is offensive and what should be removed from shelves opens the door to abuses of power, cultural erasure, and stifling creativity.

While some argue that computers have numerous benefits such as enhancing hand-eye coordination, facilitating learning about distant places and cultures, and enabling online communication, it is important to recognize that excessive computer usage may hinder other crucial aspects of life.\n\nUndoubtedly, computers have contributed positively towards the development of hand-eye coordination. Whether it involves playing video games or working on artistic projects with design software, the use of computers can improve one's ability to coordinate their hand movements with visual stimuli. This can enhance motor skills and spatial awareness, providing individuals with a valuable skill set.\n\nAdditionally, computers have opened up new opportunities for people to learn about faraway places and diverse cultures. With just a few clicks, individuals can access a wealth of information that was previously inaccessible. This virtual exploration allows for a greater understanding and appreciation of our global community. Furthermore, online communication has undoubtedly revolutionized the way people interact.

Additionally, computers provide a platform for online communication, allowing us to connect and engage with individuals from diverse backgrounds and cultures. However, we must not overlook the detrimental consequences that excessive computer use has on people's lives and society as a whole.\n\nOne of the major concerns is the sedentary lifestyle that computers encourage. People are spending increasing amounts of time glued to their screens, neglecting the importance of physical exercise. This lack of activity can have severe implications for our health, contributing to the rise of obesity, diabetes, and other lifestyle-related diseases. Moreover, the excessive screen time detracts individuals from appreciating and enjoying the natural world. It discourages them from going outdoors, exploring nature, and engaging in outdoor activities that are crucial for maintaining a balanced and healthy lifestyle.\n\nIn addition to the physical consequences, the excessive use of computers also hampers interpersonal relationships. As people become engrossed in their virtual interactions, they often neglect the importance of face-to-face communication with family and friends. Genuine human connection is crucial for our emotional wellbeing and the overall cohesion of our communities. By substituting real-life interactions with virtual ones, we risk eroding the bonds that hold us together and compromising the support systems that are essential for a thriving society.\n\nUltimately, the negative impact of excessive computer use outweighs the benefits that they provide. While computers can foster certain skills and enable connections, they should be used judiciously and in moderation. It is imperative that we strike a balance between the virtual world and the real world, maintaining a healthy equilibrium that allows us to enjoy the benefits of technology without sacrificing our physical and emotional wellbeing.\n\nTo mitigate these issues, I propose multiple strategies"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 601}}]

The harsh and desolate environment, marked by ghost towns and abandoned buildings, creates a sense of isolation and desperation for the cyclist. The lack of resources and the changing terrain intensify their physical and mental challenges, leading to a profound impact on their well-being.\n\nThe setting's impact on the cyclist is evident through various examples in the essay. Firstly, the lack of accessible water sources in the desert creates a critical situation for the protagonist. When they reach a pump, the water is unfit for consumption, leaving them dehydrated and struggling to continue their journey. This lack of water not only affects their physical capabilities but also contributes to their mental state, as they contemplate the possibility of heatstroke and death.\n\nFurthermore, the ever-changing terrain adds another layer of difficulty for the cyclist. Initially, the protagonist encounters flat roads, but as they progress, the terrain becomes hilly and challenging to navigate. This change in terrain causes exhaustion and a sense of hopelessness, as the cyclist realizes they are far from their destination with limited resources. The essay highlights the moment when the cyclist encounters a large snake on the road, which reinforces the dangerous and unpredictable nature of their surroundings.\n\nThe presence of abandoned towns and buildings further intensifies the cyclist's experience. The essay describes these places as ghost towns, emphasizing their isolation and decay. The protagonist encounters an abandoned Grape Juice factory, which serves as a metaphor for shattered dreams and unfulfilled hopes. These desolate environments contribute to the cyclist's feelings of despair and reinforce the idea that their reliance on advice from the old men has led them astray.\n\nOverall, the features of the setting in the essay significantly impact the cyclist. The lack of accessible water, the changing terrain, and the presence of abandoned locations create a sense of isolation, desperation, and physical exhaustion for the protagonist. These elements demonstrate the importance of considering the environment when embarking on any journey, as it can greatly influence one's experience and well-being."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens": 412, "total_tokens": 1796}}]

The author starts his ride with excitement and optimism, looking forward to the cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite National Park. However, as he follows the advice of the old codgers and ventures into unfamiliar territory, he encounters various challenges that have a significant impact on his experience.\n\nFirstly, the author describes coming across a ghost town, which signifies the changing landscape and the decline of once-thriving communities. This unexpected encounter disrupts the cyclist's expectations and foreshadows the difficulties that lie ahead. The deserted town also serves as a reminder that relying solely on outdated advice can lead to unfavorable outcomes.\n\nAdditionally, the scarcity of water becomes a crucial factor in the cyclist's journey. The unforgiving heat and lack of reliable water sources intensify his physical and mental exhaustion. The author's struggle with the rusted water pump and the only available brackish water highlights the debilitating effects of dehydration. He is forced to ration the little water he has left and face the possibility of heatstroke.\n\nFurthermore, the rugged terrain and the warning of a rough road ahead add to the cyclist's challenges. The combination of rolling hills, tumbleweeds, and a large snake obstructs his path and compromises his balance in a dehydrated state. This physical trial exacerbates the cyclist's sense of desperation and raises doubts about his ability to reach his destination.\n\nThe abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory encapsulates the cyclist's sense of despair and hopelessness. This derelict structure, symbolizing faded dreams and unfulfilled promises, serves as a stark contrast to the cyclist's initial optimism. As he contemplates his impending demise, the mention of sucking on stones to distract from thirst exemplifies the cyclist's increasing desperation and willingness to do anything to alleviate his suffering.\n\nFinally, the sudden relief and triumph experienced upon reaching Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp demonstrate the transformative power of the setting. To the cyclist's immense relief, he encounters a modern bathroom where he can quench his thirst.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Throughout the story, Saeng grapples with a sense of loss and longing for her homeland in Vietnam. Seeing the familiar plant at the florist shop triggers a wave of nostalgia and reminds her of her grandmother and the traditions she left behind.\n\nAs Saeng interacts with the plants at the florist shop, she is transported back to her childhood world filled with greenery and natural beauty. The plants remind her of the familiar sights, scents, and memories she had in Vietnam. The author describes the plants in vivid detail, emphasizing their importance in Saeng's emotional journey and connection to her roots.\n\nFurthermore, when Saeng brings home the hibiscus plant and plants it in the garden, it symbolizes her acceptance and adaptation to her new home in the United States. Initially, Saeng is skeptical of the \"winter hibiscus\" because it is different from the hibiscus she knew in Vietnam. However, her mother reassures her that what matters is its strength to survive in the cold months, highlighting the resilience and adaptability that Saeng must also possess.\n\nThe paragraph's mention of the geese returning in the spring further symbolizes renewal and the cyclical nature of life. As the geese return and the hibiscus buds, it suggests that Saeng's emotional wounds will heal with time, and she will be ready to face her challenges again. By vowing to retake the driver's test, Saeng demonstrates her determination to overcome her failures and regain her sense of agency and control. It signifies her progress in embracing her new life and finding a sense of belonging in her adopted country.\n\nOverall, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to showcase Saeng's growth, resilience, and her willingness to embrace her new life in the United States while still honoring her heritage. The continued presence of the hibiscus and the geese returning symbolize the possibility of finding beauty and familiarity in unfamiliar places and the potential for renewal and growth in the face of adversity."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1956, "completion_tokens": 425, "total_tokens": 2381}}]

As Katherine Paterson astutely points out, the removal of any single work that we find objectionable from library shelves would ultimately lead to a void of knowledge and ideas. Thus, I firmly believe that censoring certain materials, be it books, music, movies, magazines, or any other form of expression, is an infringement on our fundamental right to intellectual freedom. This essay aims to substantiate this stance by delving into the importance of unrestricted access to information, fostering critical thinking, and preserving cultural diversity.\n\nBody Paragraph 1: Intellectual Freedom as the Foundation of an Enlightened Society\nAccess to diverse perspectives and ideas inherently nurtures an enlightened society. Censorship in libraries undermines the core principle of intellectual freedom, which promotes the unbridled exchange of knowledge, contrasting viewpoints, and the pursuit of truth. Books or other materials deemed offensive by some individuals should not be removed solely due to subjective opinions, as this deprives individuals of the opportunity to engage in open discourse and form their own informed perspectives.\n\nBody Paragraph 2: Fostering Critical Thinking and Personal Growth\nThe presence of potentially offensive materials in libraries fosters critical thinking and personal growth. By engaging with controversial subjects, individuals are encouraged to confront divergent ideas and challenge their own biases. Exposure to a broad spectrum of literature and information is a crucial aspect of intellectual development, promoting empathy, resilience, and the ability to analyze complex issues critically. Removing offensive materials from library shelves would hinder this growth, stifling genuine personal enlightenment.\n\nBody Paragraph 3: Safeguarding Cultural Diversity and Historical Accuracy\nCensorship in libraries endangers cultural diversity by limiting access to narratives that offer unique perspectives on history, politics, and society. Each book, however controversial, contributes to a tapestry of collective knowledge that shapes our understanding of the world. Eradicating offensive works would deny individuals the opportunity to explore diverse cultural landscapes and learn from historical mistakes. It is through such exposure that we can establish tolerance, appreciation, and an understanding of the complexities that make up our global community.\n\nCounterargument and Rebuttal:\n"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 171, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 621}}]

She was known throughout the village for her unwavering patience and kind-hearted nature.\n\nLily worked as a primary school teacher and had a profound love for her students. She firmly believed in the power of education and aimed to nurture young minds to reach their full potential. One day, a new student named Ethan joined her class. Ethan was a reserved and introverted child, struggling with the demanding academical curriculum.\n\nInitially, Lily was concerned about Ethan's progress, noticing the difficulty he faced with grasping new concepts and keeping up with the class. However, she instinctively knew that patience and understanding would be key to unlocking Ethan's potential. Determined, she embarked on a journey to help him thrive.\n\nLily spent countless hours after school, tirelessly working with Ethan to break down complex subjects into manageable pieces. She employed creative teaching methods, using visual aids, interactive games, and personalized attention. Despite encountering numerous setbacks and Ethan's occasional frustration, she remained calm and composed, never questioning his abilities.\n\nWitnessing Lily's unwavering patience, Ethan began to feel a sense of comfort and trust. With each passing day, he gained confidence and started to actively participate in class discussions. Lily's gentle approach provided him with an environment where mistakes were seen as stepping stones rather than failures.\n\nOne sunny day, during a science experiment, Ethan accidentally spilled a solution all over his notebook, ruining hours of his hard work. Lily noticed the disappointment etched on his face but instead of reprimanding him, she offered a reassuring smile and helped him begin again. In that moment, Ethan realized the true power of patience. He realized that even in moments of frustration, there was always room for growth and support.\n\nOver time, Ethan's academic performance improved significantly. He evolved into an inquisitive and enthusiastic learner. Lily's persistence and unwavering belief in him molded him into a resilient child with an appetite for knowledge.

Katherine Paterson's quote highlights the delicate balance between personal beliefs and the removal of potentially offensive materials from libraries. While it is understandable that individuals may have objections towards certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I firmly believe that censorship in libraries is damaging to our intellectual growth and ought to be avoided.\n\nBody:\n\n1. Intellectual Development:\nCensorship stifles intellectual curiosity and impedes personal growth. By limiting access to certain materials, we deny ourselves the opportunity to explore different perspectives and challenge our established beliefs. A diverse range of ideas and opinions allows individuals to develop critical thinking skills, fostering a society that is well-informed and open-minded.\n\n2. The Slippery Slope:\nOnce we start censoring materials deemed offensive by some, we are on a slippery slope towards censorship of all kinds. What may be considered offensive by one person could be valuable and informative to another. By creating a precedent for censorship, we risk removing materials that promote essential conversations on topics like mental health, historical events, or societal injustices. This erosion of knowledge endangers our collective growth and understanding.\n\n3. Parental Responsibility:\nIt is the responsibility of parents and guardians, not the libraries, to monitor and guide their children's access to particular materials. Libraries already have age-appropriate sections and policies in place to assist parents in this regard. Child-rearing should be a personal decision, allowing families to instill their own values and beliefs without imposing them on the wider society.\n\n4. Promoting Empathy and Understanding:\nLiterature and other forms of art act as powerful mediums to explore diverse cultures, experiences, and identities. Exposure to challenging materials helps foster empathy, tolerance, and understanding in society. By censoring offensive materials, we risk closing ourselves off from important discussions that encourage growth as individuals and as a community.\n\n5. Historical Precedence:\nHistory serves as a reminder of the dangers of censorship. From Nazi book burnings to oppressive regimes banning undesirable content, acts of censorship have often been used as tools of control and suppression.

The author finds themselves in a remote and unfamiliar location, relying on the advice of a group of old gentlemen who have not ventured beyond their porches in years. These old-timers provide the cyclist with travel advice, leading them to take a supposed shortcut to Yosemite National Park. However, this decision results in a series of challenging and dangerous situations that greatly affect the cyclist.\n\nFirstly, the author encounters a \"ghost town\" as their first stop, which highlights how the setting has changed over the years. The town, once thriving, is now abandoned and offers no resources or assistance to the cyclist. This lack of civilization in the remote setting emphasizes the isolation and vulnerability of the cyclist.\n\nMoreover, the scarcity of water in the high deserts of California further adds to the challenges faced by the cyclist. The rusty pump the author encounters offers only brackish, scorching water that is undrinkable, forcing the cyclist to ration their limited water supply. The oppressive heat and the lack of potable water contribute to the cyclist's physical exhaustion and severe dehydration, creating a life-threatening situation.\n\nThe rough and treacherous road conditions also contribute to the cyclist's struggles. The author encounters a sign warning of a rough road ahead that advises not to exceed the speed limit. However, the cyclist's speed of 12 mph pales in comparison to the 55 mph speed limit, highlighting the disparity between their progress and the difficulty of the terrain. The presence of tumbleweeds and a large snake further adds to the challenges faced by the cyclist and reinforces the harshness of the setting.\n\nAs the cyclist continues their journey, the absence of any signs of civilization intensifies the cyclist's feelings of hopelessness and despair. The abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory serves as a stark reminder of lost dreams and the futility of the cyclist's situation. The author's mental and physical deterioration is evident as they contemplate their impending death in this desolate and unforgiving setting.\n\nHowever, the essay takes a turn when the cyclist stumbles upon Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp.

And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment.

The unforgiving terrain, lack of water, and abandonment contribute to the cyclist's physical and emotional struggles throughout the ride.\n\nFirstly, the harsh and changing terrain affects the cyclist's physical capabilities and endurance. The essay describes how the cyclist starts off with \"strong legs and a smile on [his] face\" but soon encounters rolling hills and rough roads that slow down his pace. The difficulty in navigating these challenging terrains significantly drains his energy and exacerbates his dehydration. For instance, the mention of a steep hill and the struggle to maneuver down it shows how the physical challenges of the setting test the cyclist's strength and stamina.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of water sources in the setting intensifies the cyclist's physical discomfort and weakens his well-being. The essay describes how the cyclist tries to pump water from a rusty pump but only gets brackish water that tastes like battery acid. This deprivation of clean, refreshing water heightens his dehydration. The scarcity of water is further emphasized when the cyclist mentions that he had been hitting his water bottles regularly but still finds himself with only a few tantalizing sips remaining. This shortage of water forces the cyclist to ration his water and endure the physical consequences of extreme thirst.\n\nMoreover, the abandonment and desolation of the setting exacerbate the cyclist's emotional state and feelings of helplessness. The essay mentions riding through ghost towns and encountering an abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory. These deserted, dilapidated structures serve as a harsh reminder of the cyclist's isolation and vulnerability. The absence of any signs of civilization, such as buildings or cars, intensifies his feelings of despair and increases his belief that he may not survive. The cyclist's internal monologue, filled with resignation and thoughts of mortality, showcases the emotional toll that the desolate setting takes on him.\n\nIn conclusion, the features of the setting greatly impact the cyclist in the source essay. The challenging terrain, lack of water, and abandonment all contribute to the cyclist's physical and emotional struggles throughout his journey. The difficult terrain tests his physical endurance, the scarcity of water increases his dehydration, and the desolation reinforces his feelings of isolation and helplessness."}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 1834}}]

While some argue that offensive materials should be removed from shelves to protect children or maintain societal values, I firmly believe in defending intellectual freedom and opposing any form of censorship. In this essay, I will present compelling arguments derived from personal experiences, observations, and literature to emphasize the importance of maintaining diverse and uncensored collections in libraries.\n\nBody:\n\n1. Upholding Individual Autonomy:\nCensorship restricts our ability to make informed choices about what we read, watch, or listen to. Individuals have different values, beliefs, and perspectives, and it is crucial to respect this diversity. By censoring materials, we undermine personal autonomy, limiting the potential for personal growth and intellectual development. Encountering challenging or offensive content allows us to develop critical thinking skills, question established notions, and foster empathy and understanding towards differing viewpoints.\n\n2. Protection of Intellectual Freedom:\nLibraries serve as guardians of knowledge, committed to preserving and disseminating ideas, regardless of their controversial nature. Intellectual freedom is the bedrock of a democratic society, fostering debate, innovation, and progress. If we allow offensive materials to be removed from shelves, we risk diluting the rich tapestry of literature, art, and media that fuels intellectual curiosity and diverse perspectives.\n\n3. Parental Responsibility and the Role of Libraries:\nIt is essential to acknowledge the role of parents in guiding their children's access to information. Libraries can provide resources such as age-appropriate sections or parental advisory labels to assist parents in making informed decisions. However, it is not the role of libraries to act as moral arbiters for all families. To safeguard individual liberty, libraries should empower parents with resources and information, rather than imposing uniform censorship.\n\n4. The Slippery Slope of Censorship:\nGranting permission to remove offensive materials sets a dangerous precedent. What one person finds offensive may not be offensive to another. The subjectivity of offense renders censorship a slippery slope, where decisions can be influenced by personal biases and preferences, leading to unjustifiable limitations on access to information."}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 171, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 621}}]

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Throughout the story, Saeng's move to the United States from Vietnam is depicted as a significant loss of her home, family, and culture. The familiar plants in the florist shop evoke memories of her childhood and grandmother, providing a temporary connection to her past. However, the author emphasizes that these familiar plants are different from their original counterparts, symbolizing the changes Saeng has experienced.\n\nThe loss and longing Saeng feels is portrayed when she weeps in the greenhouse and confides in her mother about failing her driver's test. The hibiscus plant, referred to as a \"winter hibiscus,\" represents Saeng's resilience and ability to adapt to her new environment. Despite it being different from the saebba hedge and other plants in her childhood garden, Saeng's mother emphasizes its strength and ability to survive the cold months. This serves as a metaphor for Saeng's own journey in adapting to a new country and finding strength to face challenges.\n\nThe mention of the geese returning in the spring further symbolizes the cyclical nature of life and the possibility of new beginnings. Just as the geese migrate and then return, Saeng expresses her determination to retake her driver's test when the hibiscus is budding and the snows have melted. This illustrates her perseverance and optimism for the future, indicating that she is willing to embrace change and try again despite past failures.\n\nBy concluding the story with this paragraph, the author leaves the reader with a sense of hope and the belief that Saeng's experiences of loss and adaptation have molded her into a resilient and determined individual. It highlights the theme of finding solace and strength in familiar elements, even when they have been altered, and the power of looking towards the future with optimism."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1956, "completion_tokens": 429, "total_tokens": 2385}}]

In this essay, I will argue against censorship in libraries, asserting that the removal of offensive materials would only lead to a deprivation of knowledge, intellectual growth, and the stifling of diverse perspectives.\n\nFirst Paragraph: Intellectual Growth and Knowledge\nCensorship in libraries would impede the intellectual growth and acquisition of knowledge among individuals. By eliminating offensive materials, we limit our ability to explore diverse ideas, perspectives, and historical accounts. Literature often confronts uncomfortable topics, challenging our preconceived notions and fostering critical thinking. Shielding individuals from such literature hinders their capacity for personal and intellectual growth, depriving future generations of the opportunity to learn from the past and progress toward a better future.\n\nSecond Paragraph: The Power of Choice and Individual Autonomy\nCensoring library materials also infringes upon the basic principles of individual autonomy and personal choice. By granting any one individual or group the authority to determine what is offensive, we risk limiting the intellectual freedom of others. What one person finds offensive, another may find enlightening or critical in understanding different perspectives. It is essential that individuals are trusted to make their own decisions about what they read, watch, or listen to, rather than being subjected to a homogenized view of what is deemed acceptable or appropriate.\n\nThird Paragraph: Promoting Critical Thinking and Tolerance\nOffensive materials, while generating discomfort, have the potential to lead to valuable discussions around complex topics and drive critical thinking. Exposure to diverse ideas and alternative viewpoints ensures that individuals are equipped to engage in discourse, fostering open-mindedness and tolerance. Removing offensive materials from library shelves limits the opportunity for individuals to confront differing ideas, hindering the development of empathy and understanding.\n\nFourth Paragraph: Encouraging Responsible Consumption\nRather than resorting to censorship, we should strive to encourage responsible consumption of offensive materials.

While some claim that protecting children from objectionable content is paramount, it is essential to recognize that imposing censorship undermines the fundamental principles of intellectual freedom, diversity, and personal choice.

Intellectual Freedom and Personal Autonomy:\nThe freedom to access a wide range of materials, be it books, music, movies, or magazines, is an essential component of personal autonomy and intellectual growth. Removing offensive works not only infringes upon an individual's right to freely explore diverse ideas and opinions, but it also restricts their intellectual development and ability to shape their own beliefs.

Rather than shielding individuals from differing perspectives, libraries should serve as a platform for fostering understanding and tolerance. By exposing readers to different viewpoints, even those they might find uncomfortable, libraries help cultivate empathy and promote dialogue. It is through engaging with opposing ideas that individuals can sharpen their own beliefs and contribute positively to society.\n\n3.

While it is understandable that certain books, music, movies, or magazines may be perceived as offensive, it is vital to recognize that embracing censorship jeopardizes the very essence of a diverse and inclusive society. By allowing everyone the right to dictate what is available, we run the great risk of depriving ourselves, and future generations, of the vast array of knowledge, perspectives, and creative expression that are crucial to personal growth and societal development.\n\nBody:\n\n1. The Importance of Intellectual Freedom:\nIntellectual freedom lies at the core of a democratic society. Libraries, as repositories of knowledge and platforms for free expression, play a critical role in fostering an informed and enlightened citizenry. By keeping a broad range of materials available, libraries ensure that individuals have the opportunity to explore various ideas, perspectives, and interpretations of the world. Censorship undermines this fundamental freedom and restricts society's ability to engage in open discourse.\n\n2. Nurturing Critical Thinking and Awareness:\nAccess to controversial or offensive materials in libraries provides an opportunity for individuals, particularly children, to develop critical thinking skills and gain a broader understanding of the world. Shielding individuals from every discomforting or challenging idea denies them the chance to learn how to analyze, question, and form their own informed opinions. Rather than focusing on removing these materials, libraries should emphasize the importance of engaging in dialogue and providing contextual information to guide readers' interpretation.\n\n3. The Slippery Slope of Censorship:\nCensorship, once initiated, sets a dangerous precedent that can easily spiral out of control. Allowing a select few to determine what others can read or access creates a breeding ground for authoritarianism and intellectual stagnation.

While it is true that computers have become an integral part of our lives, and many argue that they have a positive impact on society, I firmly believe that the negative consequences outweigh the benefits.\n\nUndoubtedly, computers have revolutionized various aspects of our lives. They have opened up opportunities for us to learn about faraway places, indulge in online conversations, and develop hand-eye coordination through interactive programs. However, it is crucial to consider the adverse effects that computers have on our wellbeing and social fabric.\n\nOne of the most concerning consequences of excessive computer use is the detrimental impact on physical health. Many experts have expressed concerns about the sedentary nature of computer activities, resulting in lower physical activity levels and associated health problems such as obesity and cardiovascular diseases. We cannot ignore the fact that spending excessive time in front of computer screens reduces the time available for outdoor activities, exercise, and enjoying nature. This not only affects our physical health but also limits our exposure to the natural world and impedes our overall well-being.\n\nMoreover, the widespread use of computers often leads to a decline in real-life social interactions. While online platforms may provide opportunities to connect with a seemingly infinite number of individuals, meaningful and fulfilling relationships are often sacrificed. Studies have shown that excessive use of computers can lead to social isolation, decreased emotional well-being, and a diminished sense of belonging. It is crucial to strike a balance between online interactions and real-life connections to maintain healthy relationships and enrich our lives.\n\nFurthermore, our increasing reliance on technology can have a detrimental impact on the traditional skills and knowledge that have been passed down through generations. As we become more dependent on computers for information and problem-solving, our ability to think critically, analyze situations, and tackle challenges independently may diminish. It is essential to recognize the importance of human connection, intuition, and creativity, as these qualities are what make us uniquely human.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the positive aspects that computers bring to our lives, I firmly believe that their negative consequences outweigh the benefits. Excessive computer use contributes to declining physical health, reduces real-life social interactions, and poses a threat to our traditional skills"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 601}}]

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Our imagination was ablaze with thoughts of long walks on the shoreline, bonfires under the stars, and experiencing a newfound freedom together.\n\nOn the second day of our trip, we decided to explore the surrounding cliffs, eager to capture breathtaking views on our cameras. Although our enthusiasm was unwavering, our hiking skills were somewhat lacking. In our eagerness to reach the summit, we overlooked an important detail - adequate footwear.\n\nHalfway up the steep slope, disaster struck. My friend, Sarah, who was leading the charge, slipped on a loose gravel patch and tumbled backward. The sight was alarming, but her abrupt descent was quickly overpowered by her subsequent reaction, a burst of uncontrollable laughter. As her body came to a stop, Sarah lay there, gripping her midsection and laughing so hard that tears streamed down her face.\n\nThough initially concerned, our worry transformed into contagious amusement as we joined in her laughter. Her unexpected joy in the midst of an unfortunate event brought an aura of lightness and camaraderie, making us forget the rugged terrain and the discomfort of our aching feet. It was a moment that encapsulated the power of shared laughter, bonding us together in a deep and genuine way.\n\nFrom that point forward, our genuine and resounding laughter became the thread that wove together the tapestry of our road trip. Whether it was in our feeble attempts to start a bonfire - resulting in clouds of smoke and futile efforts - or our hilarious misadventures with unfamiliar beach games,  humor became an integral part of every experience. We laughed until"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 77, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 527}}]

While it is true that computers have become an integral part of our lives, I firmly believe that they have had a predominantly positive effect on society.\n\nTo begin with, computers have proven to be excellent tools for teaching hand-eye coordination. The wide range of games and simulations available allow individuals, especially children, to develop essential motor skills while having fun. Additionally, this technology has opened up a world of learning opportunities, enabling people to explore faraway places and interact with diverse cultures. Online resources and virtual travel experiences foster global understanding and foster a sense of interconnectedness in our increasingly globalized world.\n\nFurthermore, computers provide us with the ability to connect with others online. Social media platforms and other networking websites allow individuals to communicate and form relationships with people across the globe. This not only expands our social circles but also promotes cross-cultural understanding and tolerance. The internet has become a powerful tool for activism, allowing people to come together and effect positive change in their communities.\n\nContrary to the concerns of some experts, I believe that the notion that people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends due to computers is misleading. While it is vital for individuals to engage in physical activity and nurture personal relationships, computers do not necessarily undermine these pursuits. In fact, the digital world offers numerous opportunities to promote physical well-being, such as fitness apps, online workout classes, and health tracking devices.\n\nMoreover, computers have become a bridge between generations, allowing families to stay connected even when physically apart. The ability to video call and share moments through social media platforms has become priceless, particularly during times of separation or long-distance relationships. Computers enhance communication and foster closeness, strengthening family bonds rather than weakening them.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of computers far outweigh any potential drawbacks. They provide necessary skills, global connectivity, and opportunities for personal growth. Computers are not isolating; instead, they promote interaction, understanding, and progress. It is essential to embrace the positive effects that technology has brought into our lives and continue to harness its power for the betterment of society.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 601}}]

While some may argue that excessive computer usage can lead to negative consequences, such as reduced physical activity and decreased social interaction, I maintain that the advantages outweigh these concerns.\n\nFirstly, computers play a crucial role in promoting hand-eye coordination. In this rapidly advancing technological age, proficiency in using computers has become an essential skill. Whether it's for work, education, or leisure, individuals who possess good hand-eye coordination are more likely to excel in various aspects of life. Video games, for example, have been proven to sharpen reflexes and enhance coordination, making them valuable tools for skill development.\n\nFurthermore, computers provide an unparalleled opportunity for people to connect with faraway places and individuals. Through the internet, anyone can access vast amounts of information, explore different cultures, and learn about diverse perspectives. This exposure fosters open-mindedness, tolerance, and global awareness. It allows us to transcend geographical boundaries and interact with people from different backgrounds, significantly broadening our horizons.\n\nMoreover, online communication platforms have revolutionized the way we connect with others. Social media, email, and video conferencing applications facilitate long-distance communication, enabling individuals to maintain relationships across continents. This is particularly crucial in today's world, as travel is often limited, and physical distance should not inhibit personal connections. These platforms have the power to bridge gaps and bring people together, fostering a sense of unity and community.\n\nWhile concerns over excessive computer usage are valid, it is important to acknowledge that balance and moderation are key. Instead of completely avoiding computers, we should educate individuals on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle that includes physical activities, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with family and friends. Computers can actually be utilized to support those activities, such as using fitness apps or organizing outdoor events through online platforms. It is not the technology itself that is at fault, but rather the responsibility lies with individuals to strike a healthy balance.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have a positive effect on society. They enhance hand-eye coordination, enable us to learn about diverse cultures, and facilitate connections with people from around the world.

No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It's not that a group of old guys doesn't know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park. They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. It didn't matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it really did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my sirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine.Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment.

The features of the setting contribute to the challenges and difficulties that the cyclist faces, ultimately affecting their physical and emotional state.\n\nOne aspect of the setting that affects the cyclist is the harsh, unforgiving terrain. As the essay describes, the cyclist travels through the high deserts of California in June, where the temperature rises and water becomes scarce. The arid and dry landscape intensifies the cyclist's thirst and dehydration, pushing them to the brink of heatstroke. The essay illustrates this when the cyclist is forced to drink brackish water from a rusty pump and suffers the consequences of choosing a shortcut that leads to more challenging terrain. The harshness of the environment adds to the physical strain and exhaustion the cyclist experiences.\n\nAdditionally, the towns along the cyclist's route impact their journey. The essay mentions encountering ghost towns and abandoned buildings, which highlight the desolation and isolation of the area. When the cyclist arrives at the deserted Welch's Grape Juice factory, it becomes a symbol of shattered hopes and disappointment. The absence of resources and assistance in these towns further exacerbates the cyclist's plight. They are left to face the challenges of the environment alone, without the support or guidance they had expected from the locals.\n\nThe essay also portrays the impact of the setting on the cyclist's emotions.

As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else.

For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Throughout the story, Saeng experiences a strong sense of loss, as she reflects on her homeland in Vietnam and the memories associated with it. The familiar plants in the florist shop evoke nostalgia and a longing for her past. However, as Saeng helps her mother plant the \"winter hibiscus,\" she begins to see that she has also found familiarity and comfort in her new surroundings.\n\nThe symbolism of the approaching spring, the melting snows, and the returning geese represents a fresh start and the cyclical nature of life.

By vowing to retake her driver's test in the spring, she exhibits determination and resilience in the face of failure.\n\nThe author's choice to end the story with this paragraph emphasizes the theme of adaptation and finding solace in new experiences. Saeng realizes that, although her past may hold cherished memories, she can create new ones in her current environment. The act of planting the hibiscus symbolizes a connection to her roots and a sense of belonging, even in this new place.\n\nFurthermore, the author's use of sensory details and specific plants throughout the story enhances the impact of Saeng's journey. Saeng's recognition and familiarity with the plants in the florist shop evoke strong emotions and memories from her childhood. The vivid descriptions of the plants, such as the hibiscus, jasmine, and dok Malik, highlight the richness of her cultural heritage and the importance of preserving those connections.\n\nIn conclusion, the author concludes the story with the paragraph about Saeng's vow to retake the driver's test in the spring to portray a message of resilience, hope, and growth.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le?

Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It's not that a group of old guys doesn't know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park. They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. It didn't matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it really did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my sirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine.Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment.

The setting, which includes abandoned towns, rough roads, extreme heat, and a lack of resources, creates a hostile environment for the cyclist.\n\nFirstly, the abandoned towns along the cyclist's route contribute to the challenges faced. The essay describes the first town as a \"ghost town\" and the second as having a dilapidated corral and rusty pumps. These towns do not provide any amenities or services for the cyclist, causing a scarcity of essential resources such as water. This scarcity forces the cyclist to ration their water and exposes them to dehydration and heatstroke.\n\nIn addition to the abandoned towns, the rough road conditions also impact the cyclist. The cyclist encounters rolling hills and a sign warning of rough terrain ahead. The rough road, combined with the cyclist's dehydrated state, makes the journey more physically demanding and increases the risk of accidents. The presence of tumbleweeds and a large snake further highlight the challenging nature of the terrain.\n\nFurthermore, the extreme heat exacerbates the difficulties faced by the cyclist. The essay mentions riding through the high deserts of California in June, where temperatures can be oppressive. The cyclist describes themselves as dehydrated and suffering from heatstroke symptoms. The oppressive heat saps their energy and compromises their physical and mental well-being, making the journey even more arduous.\n\nOverall, these features of the setting contribute to the cyclist's struggles and highlight the impact of the environment on their experience.

How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

[{"model": "gpt-3.5-turbo", "max_tokens": 450, "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "You will be given an essay prompt. Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Throughout the story, Saeng is depicted as an immigrant girl who nostalgically yearns for her homeland and her lost memories and connections. The familiar plant, the dok faeng-noi (winter hibiscus), symbolizes her connection to her past and her determination to find belonging in her new home.\n\nThe paragraph ties together several elements from the story to emphasize Saeng's resilience and her ability to adapt to her new surroundings. Saeng's vow to retake the driving test in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return, symbolizes her determination to persist and overcome the challenges and disappointments she faces. This reflects her inner strength and determination to create a future for herself in her new home. \n\nFurthermore, the symbolism of the dok faeng-noi being planted in the garden by Saeng and her mother further reinforces the theme of resilience and hope. The plant, referred to as a \"winter hibiscus,\" is a hardy variety that can survive the cold months, just like Saeng and her family are learning to adapt and survive in their new environment. By planting this flower, Saeng and her mother demonstrate their ability to find beauty and hope even in unfamiliar circumstances.\n\nMoreover, Saeng's choice to plant the dok faeng-noi in the garden suggests her commitment to nurture and grow her sense of belonging and connection to her new home. By doing so, she acknowledges that while she may long for her homeland and the memories associated with it, she can also create new memories and find joy in her current environment.\n\nOverall, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to highlight Saeng's resilience, hope, and her ongoing journey of adaptation in her new home. Through the symbolism of the dok faeng-noi and the vow to retake the driving test, the author conveys that despite the pain of loss and displacement, Saeng is determined to forge a new"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1956, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 2406}}]

While some critics argue that excessive computer usage hinders physical activity, nature appreciation, and social interactions, I argue that computers have revolutionized our lives, allowing for greater opportunities and enhancing various aspects of our existence.\n\nFirstly, computers have become indispensable tools for education and acquiring knowledge. They provide individuals with the ability to access a wealth of information about faraway places and different cultures. Through online platforms and digital resources, people can immerse themselves in all corners of the world, fostering a sense of global interconnectedness. The ability to explore diverse perspectives and engage with online communities also enhances critical thinking and cultural understanding.\n\nFurthermore, computers foster hand-eye coordination and cognitive skills. Numerous studies have shown that interactive computer games have been beneficial in developing problem-solving abilities, strategic thinking, and enhancing hand-eye coordination in both children and adults. Without the use of computers, these skills would be less accessible to a vast number of individuals, thereby limiting their personal growth and development.\n\nAnother crucial advantage of computers is the ability to connect individuals around the world. Social networking platforms have provided a space for people to communicate, collaborate, and share ideas. With the click of a button, we can engage with like-minded individuals who share our passions, interests, and values. These online interactions create a sense of belonging and community, especially for those who may feel isolated in their offline lives. Furthermore, computers offer communication channels that bridge geographical barriers and enable families and friends to stay connected, even when physically apart.\n\nDespite the concerns raised by critics, it is essential to consider the balance and responsibility in our computer usage. It is true that excessive screen time may lead to a sedentary lifestyle and reduced physical activity. However, this issue can be addressed by promoting the importance of incorporating exercise and outdoor activities into our daily routines. Rather than blaming computers, we should focus on encouraging a healthy lifestyle that includes a balanced mix of both screen time and physical engagement.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits brought about by computers far outweigh the potential drawbacks. They open a world of knowledge, enhance cognitive capabilities, foster social connections, and offer a"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 601}}]

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance. When they come back, Saeng vowed silently to herself, in the spring, when the snows melt and the geese return and this hibiscus is budding, then I will take that test again.Now read the last paragraph of the story.

The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Hydrogen is highly flammable, as demonstrated by the tragic destruction of the German dirigible Hindenburg in 1937. This presented a significant safety concern, especially considering the densely populated area surrounding the Empire State Building. The owners realized the potential danger and the disastrous consequences that could arise if a similar accident were to occur above downtown New York.\n\nAdditionally, the builders had to contend with the challenging nature of the winds on top of the building. Due to violent air currents, the winds constantly shifted, making it difficult and risky for dirigibles to remain tethered to the mooring mast. The back of the dirigible would swivel around the mast, posing potential dangers to the structure itself and even pedestrians on the street below. Unlike in open landing fields, where dirigibles could be weighed down at the back with lead weights, this approach was neither practical nor safe in the urban setting of the Empire State Building.\n\nFurthermore, the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas further complicated the docking plans. This law made it illegal for a dirigible to tie up or even approach the area where the Empire State Building was located. Consequently, two attempts by the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles and the Goodyear blimp Columbia to dock at the Empire State Building were unsuccessful. The strong winds and concerns about the dirigibles colliding with nearby buildings led to the abandonment of the idea altogether.\n\nIn conclusion, the builders of the Empire State Building faced obstacles including the highly flammable nature of hydrogen used in most dirigibles, the challenging winds on top of the building, and the existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. These obstacles ultimately rendered the plans for dirigibles to dock at the Empire State Building unfeasible and led to the idea being abandoned."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1963, "completion_tokens": 406, "total_tokens": 2369}}]

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: Saeng, a teenage girl, and her family have moved to the United States from Vietnam. As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le? You\u2019re back?\u201d she said cheerfully. \u201cGoodness, it\u2019s past five. What took you so long? How did it go? Did you\u2014?\u201d Then she noticed the potted plant that Saeng was holding, its leaves quivering in the wind. Mrs. Panouvong uttered a small cry of surprise and delight. \u201cDok faeng-noi!\u201d she said. \u201cWhere did you get it?\u201d \u201cI bought it,\u201d Saeng answered, dreading her mother\u2019s next question. \u201cHow much?\u201d For answer Saeng handed her mother some coins. \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Mrs. Panouvong said, appalled, \u201cOh, but I forgot! You and the Lambert boy ate Bee-Maags . . . .\u201d \u201cNo, we didn\u2019t, Mother,\u201d Saeng said. \u201cThen what else\u2014?\u201d \u201cNothing else. I paid over nineteen dollars for it.\u201d \u201cYou what?\u201d Her mother stared at her incredulously. \u201cBut how could you? All the seeds for this vegetable garden didn\u2019t cost that much! You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

While it is undeniable that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, I firmly believe that the societal benefits they bring far outweigh any potential drawbacks.\n\nFirst and foremost, computers play a vital role in enhancing individuals' hand-eye coordination skills. Through video games, simulations, and even online puzzles, people across all age groups are able to improve their hand-eye coordination, a skill that is crucial in various professions and sports. This development not only enhances their productivity and performance but also contributes to their overall well-being and self-confidence.\n\nMoreover, computers enable us to explore and learn about faraway places and people that we may otherwise never have the opportunity to encounter. The internet provides a vast wealth of knowledge and resources, allowing individuals to expand their horizons and gain a deeper understanding of the world. This not only fosters cultural diversity and empathy but also promotes global collaboration and cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, computers facilitate online communication, which has revolutionized the way people interact and connect with others. Through social media platforms, discussion forums, and video conferencing tools, individuals can engage in meaningful conversations with like-minded individuals across the globe. This not only broadens their perspective but also fosters a sense of belonging and community, particularly for those who may feel isolated or marginalized in their physical surroundings.\n\nWhile there are concerns about people spending excessive time on their computers, it is vital to recognize that moderation and balance are essential in all aspects of life. Just as we allocate time for exercise, nature, and spending quality time with family and friends, similarly, a well-rounded lifestyle includes allocating time for technology use. It is our responsibility as individuals to strike a balance and manage our time effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, computers undoubtedly have a positive effect on people, playing a crucial role in hand-eye coordination development, expanding knowledge and understanding of the world, and facilitating meaningful connections with others. Rather than demonizing computers for the potential societal drawbacks, let us embrace the opportunities they bring and ensure a healthy balance in their usage.

While some argue for the removal of offensive materials, I firmly believe that censoring books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of artistic expression robs individuals of their right to make informed decisions and stifles intellectual growth. Through examining the negative consequences of censorship and championing the virtues of tolerance, this essay will demonstrate why restricting access to certain materials ultimately undermines the fundamental principles upon which libraries are built.\n\nBody:\n\n1. Intellectual Freedom:\nLibraries have long been regarded as bastions of intellectual freedom, serving as spaces where individuals can explore a wide range of ideas and perspectives. By censoring materials deemed offensive, we compromise the very essence of these institutions. Censorship obstructs the free flow of information and inhibits the pursuit of knowledge. In a world that thrives on innovation and progress, limiting access to controversial materials hampers the potential for intellectual growth and development.\n\n2. Protection of Individual Rights:\nWhile it is natural to be concerned about the exposure of certain materials to children, it is the role of parents and guardians, not libraries, to guide what content is appropriate for young readers. Filtering content based on subjective values infringes upon the rights of individuals to make their own choices, regardless of their age. Our responsibility as a society is to educate and empower our young ones to critically analyze and make informed decisions, rather than shielding them from every potentially offensive piece of literature.\n\n3. Broadening Perspectives:\nArtistic expression has the power to challenge societal norms and promote critical thinking. By embracing a diverse range of materials in libraries, we encourage dialogue and foster tolerance among individuals with differing viewpoints. Exposure to different perspectives facilitates personal growth and helps shape well-rounded individuals capable of empathizing with others. By removing potentially offensive content, we risk narrowing the scope of ideas, hindering the development of open-mindedness, and stifling creativity.\n\n4.

However, censorship, particularly in the form of removing books, music, movies, magazines, and other media that may be deemed offensive, inhibits this fundamental freedom of information. This essay aims to argue against the removal of potentially offensive materials from library shelves, advocating for the preservation of diverse viewpoints, critical thinking, and the cultivation of a well-rounded society.\n\nPreserving Intellectual Diversity:\nFirst and foremost, libraries serve as guardians of intellectual diversity. Different individuals possess unique perspectives and backgrounds, often leading to varying sensitivities and interpretations. The removal of materials deemed offensive by one group may infringe upon the rights and curiosity of others who value such viewpoints. By preserving a wide range of materials, libraries ensure that all patrons have the opportunity to explore diverse ideologies, promoting tolerance and understanding in an increasingly polarized society.\n\nFostering Critical Thinking:\nThe presence of potentially offensive materials within libraries actively encourages critical thinking. When faced with challenging and uncomfortable content, individuals are given the opportunity to question their own beliefs and engage in constructive debates. Censoring offensive material robs people of the chance to critically analyze different perspectives, limiting their intellectual growth. Libraries, as gatekeepers of knowledge, must allow for the free exchange of ideas, even if they provoke discomfort or disagreement.\n\nEducational Value:\nControversial materials often possess significant educational value. They shed light on historical, sociopolitical, and cultural contexts, offering insights that conventional resources may overlook. Banning such materials denies students and the general public access to important discussions surrounding pivotal issues, stunting their intellectual development and suppressing their capacity for engaged citizenship. By exposing individuals to a range of viewpoints, libraries contribute to a well-informed society ready to tackle complex challenges.\n\nMissed Opportunities for Parental Engagement:\nIt is crucial to recognize that libraries are not solely responsible for shaping a child's intellectual growth. Parents play an essential role in guiding their children's reading choices. By removing potentially offensive materials from libraries, we risk underestimating the ability of parents to monitor and guide"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 171, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 621}}]

While advances in technology have undoubtedly brought many benefits to our society, I believe it is crucial to acknowledge the potential drawbacks associated with excessive computer usage.\n\nComputers have undeniably revolutionized the way we live and have opened up tremendous opportunities for learning and connectivity. Supporters argue that computers teach hand-eye coordination, facilitate learning about distant places and cultures, and enable online communication with others. While I agree that these aspects can be valuable, we must also consider the consequences of spending too much time on our screens.\n\nOne of the most pressing concerns regarding excessive computer usage is the impact on physical health. It is no secret that sedentary lifestyles contribute to various health issues such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular problems. Spending hours in front of a computer screen leaves little time for physical activities like exercise and outdoor exploration. Our bodies are designed to move, and neglecting physical well-being in favor of excessive screen time puts our health at risk.\n\nFurthermore, computers have the potential to disrupt interpersonal relationships. While online communication offers convenience and the ability to connect with individuals worldwide, it cannot replace the richness of face-to-face interaction. The warmth of a smile, the tone of voice, and the physical presence that exists when engaging with loved ones provide a deeper level of connection. Excessive computer usage may lead to isolation, social detachment, and ultimately impact mental well-being.\n\nAnother concern is the potential negative impact on cognitive and emotional development. Excessive exposure to screens can hinder creativity, imagination, and critical thinking skills. The passive consumption of information and instant gratification often associated with computers can limit problem-solving abilities and hinder the development of a well-rounded individual. Moreover, the abundance of online content and social media can inadvertently expose individuals to harmful and negative influences, breeding feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and cyberbullying.\n\nIn conclusion, while I do acknowledge the benefits that computers bring to our society, I firmly believe that we must approach their usage with caution.

While it is true that some books, music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media may be deemed offensive to certain individuals, removing them from library shelves would undermine the very essence of intellectual freedom. In this essay, I will argue against censorship in libraries, emphasizing the importance of preserving diverse perspectives, encouraging critical thinking, and fostering an inclusive society.\n\nPreserving Intellectual Freedom:\n1. Promotion of diversity and innovation:\nCensorship limits the availability of diverse perspectives, hindering intellectual growth and innovation. Libraries serve as repositories of knowledge, providing individuals with an array of ideas, beliefs, and cultures. By eliminating materials that are found offensive by some, we restrict access to valuable works that challenge existing norms, stimulate imagination, and promote a deeper understanding of the world around us.\n\n2. Encouragement of critical thinking:\nThere is immense value in exposing individuals, especially children, to materials that may contain controversial or challenging subject matter. By encountering differing viewpoints, individuals develop critical thinking skills, allowing them to engage in informed debates, question societal norms, and form their own opinions. Rigid censorship stifles this process, leaving individuals ill-equipped to navigate the complexities of the world.\n\n3. Protection against societal censorship:\nAllowing the removal of offensive materials from library shelves sets a dangerous precedent. Who decides what is deemed offensive or inappropriate? Subjective interpretations open the floodgates to eroding intellectual freedom, as narrow perspectives and subjective biases may unfairly dictate what can and cannot be accessed publicly. It is essential to protect society from the imposition of arbitrary limitations on information and ideas.\n\n4. Parental involvement and guidance:\nRather than advocating for outright removal, libraries should cater to individual needs through the implementation of robust labeling systems and age restrictions. Parents have a crucial role to play in guiding their children's reading choices. Libraries can provide parental advisory labels, ratings, or segregated sections, allowing parents to exercise their rights and responsibilities without imposing restrictions on others.\n\nCounterarguments:\n1. Protection of vulnerable readers:\nOpponents of uncensored libraries argue"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 171, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 621}}]

It is undeniable that computers offer numerous benefits that enhance our daily lives. Firstly, they teach hand-eye coordination, a crucial skill that is becoming increasingly important in various professional fields. From surgeons performing intricate operations to designers crafting intricate digital art, computers help sharpen and refine hand-eye coordination skills, leading to improved dexterity and precision.\n\nMoreover, computers enable us to learn about faraway places and diverse cultures that we may never have the opportunity to experience in person. Access to the internet provides a gateway to a vast wealth of knowledge, allowing individuals to expand their horizons and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. From exploring historical sites through virtual tours to engaging in online language exchange programs, computers empower individuals to interact with different cultures, fostering cultural appreciation, understanding, and global harmony.\n\nAnother significant advantage of computers is the ability to communicate and connect with others, regardless of geographical boundaries. The emergence of social media platforms and online communities has enabled a rich exchange of ideas and experiences among individuals from all walks of life. Computers provide a platform for diverse voices to be heard, fostering inclusivity, empathy, and understanding. The power to connect with like-minded individuals, seek support, and engage in meaningful conversations online has resulted in stronger communities and a sense of belonging for many individuals who may not have had access to such opportunities otherwise.\n\nHowever, I acknowledge the concerns raised by some experts regarding excessive computer usage. It is crucial to find a balance in the time we spend using computers and engaging in other activities. Encouraging individuals to allocate time for exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends can be achieved through awareness campaigns, educational initiatives, and promoting responsible computer usage"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 151, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 601}}]

No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It's not that a group of old guys doesn't know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park. They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. It didn't matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it really did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my sirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine.Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group I'd listened to in Lodi. \u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d And I promised myself right then that I'd always stick to it in the future.

These features contribute to the cyclist's struggle with dehydration, exhaustion, and a sense of despair.\n\nFirstly, the desolate roads of the setting play a crucial role in the cyclist's journey. The author describes riding through a ghost town where civilization seems to have vanished. The lack of functioning water pumps and scarcity of resources, such as drinkable water, adds to the cyclist's physical and mental burdens. For example, when the cyclist encountered the rusty water pump, they struggled to extract any usable water, which had the taste of battery acid. This portrays the harsh reality of the setting and the cyclist's desperate need for hydration.\n\nSecondly, the unreliable landmarks highlight the cyclist's vulnerability and dependence on others for guidance. The old men's advice leads the cyclist astray, causing a longer and more treacherous journey. Despite their wisdom, the old men were disconnected from the changing world and unaware of the arduous conditions the cyclist would face. As a result, the cyclist is forced to navigate unfamiliar terrains, encounter dangerous wildlife, and endure extreme temperatures. This shows how the cyclist's trust in the wrong advice amplified their struggles and put them in life-threatening situations.\n\nLastly, the emotional impact of the setting is evident in the cyclist's thoughts and feelings. The isolation and absence of any signs of civilization contribute to a sense of hopelessness and despair. The imagery of the abandoned Welch's Grape Juice factory serves as a metaphor for shattered dreams and lost expectations. The cyclist contemplates their own mortality and acknowledges the irony of their situation. The setting intensifies the emotional weight of the cyclist's journey, adding depth to their internal struggle and determination to survive.\n\nIn conclusion, the features of the setting, including desolate roads, lack of resources, and unreliable landmarks, significantly impact the cyclist both physically and emotionally. The challenging conditions exacerbate the cyclist's battle with dehydration and exhaustion, while also causing feelings of despair and vulnerability. The essay underscores the importance of considering the setting when embarking upon a journey, as it can have a profound influence"}, "finish_reason": "length"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1384, "completion_tokens": 450, "total_tokens": 1834}}]

Respond it to the best of your ability: When the Empire State Building was conceived, it was planned as the world\u2019s tallest building, taller even than the new Chrysler Building that was being constructed at Forty-second Street and Lexington Avenue in New York. At seventy-seven stories, it was the tallest building before the Empire State began construction, and Al Smith was determined to outstrip it in height. The architect building the Chrysler Building, however, had a trick up his sleeve. He secretly constructed a 185-foot spire inside the building, and then shocked the public and the media by hoisting it up to the top of the Chrysler Building, bringing it to a height of 1,046 feet, 46 feet taller than the originally announced height of the Empire State Building. Al Smith realized that he was close to losing the title of world\u2019s tallest building, and on December 11, 1929, he announced that the Empire State would now reach the height of 1,250 feet. He would add a top or a hat to the building that would be even more distinctive than any other building in the city. John Tauranac describes the plan: [The top of the Empire State Building] would be more than ornamental, more than a spire or dome or a pyramid put there to add a desired few feet to the height of the building or to mask something as mundane as a water tank. Their top, they said, would serve a higher calling. The Empire State Building would be equipped for an age of transportation that was then only the dream of aviation pioneers. This dream of the aviation pioneers was travel by dirigible, or zeppelin, and the Empire State Building was going to have a mooring mast at its top for docking these new airships, which would accommodate passengers on already existing transatlantic routes and new routes that were yet to come. The Age of Dirigibles By the 1920s, dirigibles were being hailed as the transportation of the future. Also known today as blimps, dirigibles were actually enormous steel-framed balloons, with envelopes of cotton fabric filled with hydrogen and helium to make them lighter than air. Unlike a balloon, a dirigible could be maneuvered by the use of propellers and rudders, and passengers could ride in the gondola, or enclosed compartment, under the balloon. Dirigibles had a top speed of eighty miles per hour, and they could cruise at seventy miles per hour for thousands of miles without needing refueling. Some were as long as one thousand feet, the same length as four blocks in New York City. The one obstacle to their expanded use in New York City was the lack of a suitable landing area. Al Smith saw an opportunity for his Empire State Building: A mooring mast added to the top of the building would allow dirigibles to anchor there for several hours for refueling or service, and to let passengers off and on. Dirigibles were docked by means of an electric winch, which hauled in a line from the front of the ship and then tied it to a mast. The body of the dirigible could swing in the breeze, and yet passengers could safely get on and off the dirigible by walking down a gangplank to an open observation platform. The architects and engineers of the Empire State Building consulted with experts, taking tours of the equipment and mooring operations at the U.S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The navy was the leader in the research and development of dirigibles in the United States. The navy even offered its dirigible, the Los Angeles, to be used in testing the mast. The architects also met with the president of a recently formed airship transport company that planned to offer dirigible service across the Pacific Ocean. When asked about the mooring mast, Al Smith commented: [It\u2019s] on the level, all right. No kidding. We\u2019re working on the thing now. One set of engineers here in New York is trying to dope out a practical, workable arrangement and the Government people in Washington are figuring on some safe way of mooring airships to this mast. Designing the Mast The architects could not simply drop a mooring mast on top of the Empire State Building\u2019s flat roof. A thousand-foot dirigible moored at the top of the building, held by a single cable tether, would add stress to the building\u2019s frame. The stress of the dirigible\u2019s load and the wind pressure would have to be transmitted all the way to the building\u2019s foundation, which was nearly eleven hundred feet below. The steel frame of the Empire State Building would have to be modified and strengthened to accommodate this new situation. Over sixty thousand dollars\u2019 worth of modifications had to be made to the building\u2019s framework. Rather than building a utilitarian mast without any ornamentation, the architects designed a shiny glass and chrome-nickel stainless steel tower that would be illuminated from inside, with a stepped-back design that imitated the overall shape of the building itself. The rocket-shaped mast would have four wings at its corners, of shiny aluminum, and would rise to a conical roof that would house the mooring arm. The winches and control machinery for the dirigible mooring would be housed in the base of the shaft itself, which also housed elevators and stairs to bring passengers down to the eighty-sixth floor, where baggage and ticket areas would be located. The building would now be 102 floors, with a glassed-in observation area on the 101st floor and an open observation platform on the 102nd floor. This observation area was to double as the boarding area for dirigible passengers. Once the architects had designed the mooring mast and made changes to the existing plans for the building\u2019s skeleton, construction proceeded as planned. When the building had been framed to the 85th floor, the roof had to be completed before the framing for the mooring mast could take place. The mast also had a skeleton of steel and was clad in stainless steel with glass windows. Two months after the workers celebrated framing the entire building, they were back to raise an American flag again\u2014this time at the top of the frame for the mooring mast. The Fate of the Mast The mooring mast of the Empire State Building was destined to never fulfill its purpose, for reasons that should have been apparent before it was ever constructed. The greatest reason was one of safety: Most dirigibles from outside of the United States used hydrogen rather than helium, and hydrogen is highly flammable. When the German dirigible Hindenburg was destroyed by fire in Lakehurst, New Jersey, on May 6, 1937, the owners of the Empire State Building realized how much worse that accident could have been if it had taken place above a densely populated area such as downtown New York. The greatest obstacle to the successful use of the mooring mast was nature itself. The winds on top of the building were constantly shifting due to violent air currents. Even if the dirigible were tethered to the mooring mast, the back of the ship would swivel around and around the mooring mast. Dirigibles moored in open landing fields could be weighted down in the back with lead weights, but using these at the Empire State Building, where they would be dangling high above pedestrians on the street, was neither practical nor safe. The other practical reason why dirigibles could not moor at the Empire State Building was an existing law against airships flying too low over urban areas. This law would make it illegal for a ship to ever tie up to the building or even approach the area, although two dirigibles did attempt to reach the building before the entire idea was dropped. In December 1930, the U.S. Navy dirigible Los Angeles approached the mooring mast but could not get close enough to tie up because of forceful winds. Fearing that the wind would blow the dirigible onto the sharp spires of other buildings in the area, which would puncture the dirigible\u2019s shell, the captain could not even take his hands off the control levers. Two weeks later, another dirigible, the Goodyear blimp Columbia, attempted a publicity stunt where it would tie up and deliver a bundle of newspapers to the Empire State Building. Because the complete dirigible mooring equipment had never been installed, a worker atop the mooring mast would have to catch the bundle of papers on a rope dangling from the blimp. The papers were delivered in this fashion, but after this stunt the idea of using the mooring mast was shelved. In February 1931, Irving Clavan of the building\u2019s architectural office said, \u201cThe as yet unsolved problems of mooring air ships to a fixed mast at such a height made it desirable to postpone to a later date the final installation of the landing gear.\u201d By the late 1930s, the idea of using the mooring mast for dirigibles and their passengers had quietly disappeared. Dirigibles, instead of becoming the transportation of the future, had given way to airplanes. The rooms in the Empire State Building that had been set aside for the ticketing and baggage of dirigible passengers were made over into the world\u2019s highest soda fountain and tea garden for use by the sightseers who flocked to the observation decks. The highest open observation deck, intended for disembarking passengers, has never been open to the public.Now based on the excerpt, describe the obstacles the builders of the Empire State Building faced in attempting to allow dirigibles to dock there.

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: My parents, originally from Cuba, arrived in the United States in 1956. After living for a year in a furnished one-room apartment, twenty-one-year-old Rawedia Maria and twenty-seven-year-old Narciso Rodriguez, Sr., could afford to move into a modest, three-room apartment I would soon call home.In 1961, I was born into this simple house, situated in a two-family, blond-brick building in the Ironbound section of Newark, New Jersey. Within its walls, my young parents created our traditional Cuban home, the very heart of which was the kitchen. My parents both shared cooking duties and unwittingly passed on to me their rich culinary skills and a love of cooking that is still with me today (and for which I am eternally grateful). Passionate Cuban music (which I adore to this day) filled the air, mixing with the aromas of the kitchen. Here, the innocence of childhood, the congregation of family and friends, and endless celebrations that encompassed both, formed the backdrop to life in our warm home.Growing up in this environment instilled in me a great sense that \u201cfamily\u201d had nothing to do with being a blood relative. Quite the contrary, our neighborhood was made up of mostly Spanish, Cuban, and Italian immigrants at a time when overt racism was the norm and segregation prevailed in the United States. In our neighborhood, despite customs elsewhere, all of these cultures came together in great solidarity and friendship. It was a close-knit community of honest, hardworking immigrants who extended a hand to people who, while not necessarily their own kind, were clearly in need.Our landlord and his daughter, Alegria (my babysitter and first friend), lived above us, and Alegria graced our kitchen table for meals more often than not. Also at the table were Sergio and Edelmira, my surrogate grandparents who lived in the basement apartment. (I would not know my \u201creal\u201d grandparents, Narciso the Elder and Consuelo, until 1970 when they were allowed to leave Cuba.) My aunts Bertha and Juanita and my cousins Arnold, Maria, and Rosemary also all lived nearby and regularly joined us at our table. Countless extended family members came and went \u2014 and there was often someone staying with us temporarily until they were able to get back on their feet. My parents always kept their arms and their door open to the many people we considered family, knowing that they would do the same for us.My mother and father had come to this country with such courage, without any knowledge of the language or the culture. They came selflessly, as many immigrants do, to give their children a better life, even though it meant leaving behind their families, friends, and careers in the country they loved. They struggled both personally and financially, braving the harsh northern winters while yearning for their native tropics and facing cultural hardships. The barriers to work were strong and high, and my parents both had to accept that they might not be able to find the kind of jobs they deserved. In Cuba, Narciso, Sr., had worked in a laboratory and Rawedia Maria had studied chemical engineering. In the United States, they had to start their lives over entirely, taking whatever work they could find. The faith that this struggle would lead them and their children to better times drove them to endure these hard times. I will always be grateful to my parents for their love and sacrifice. I\u2019ve often told them that what they did was a much more courageous thing than I could have ever done. I\u2019ve often told them of my admiration for their strength and perseverance, and I\u2019ve thanked them repeatedly. But, in reality, there is no way to express my gratitude for the spirit of generosity impressed upon me at such an early age and the demonstration of how important family and friends are. These are two lessons that my parents did not just tell me. They showed me with their lives, and these teachings have been the basis of my life.It was in this simple house that my parents welcomed other refugees to celebrate their arrival to this country and where I celebrated my first birthdays. It was in the warmth of the kitchen in this humble house where a Cuban feast (albeit a frugal Cuban feast) always filled the air with not just scent and music but life and love. It was here where I learned the real definition of \u201cfamily.\u201d And for this, I will never forget that house or its gracious neighborhood or the many things I learned there about how to love. I will never forget how my parents turned this simple house into a home.Now describe the mood created by the author in the memoir.

No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It's not that a group of old guys doesn't know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park. They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. It didn't matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it really did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my sirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine.Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group I'd listened to in Lodi. \u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d And I promised myself right then that I'd always stick to it in the future.

As Saeng walks home after failing her driver\u2019s test, she sees a familiar plant. Later, she goes to a florist shop to see if the plant can be purchased. It was like walking into another world. A hot, moist world exploding with greenery. Huge flat leaves, delicate wisps of tendrils, ferns and fronds and vines of all shades and shapes grew in seemingly random profusion. \u201cOver there, in the corner, the hibiscus. Is that what you mean?\u201d The florist pointed at a leafy potted plant by the corner. There, in a shaft of the wan afternoon sunlight, was a single blood-red blossom, its five petals splayed back to reveal a long stamen tipped with yellow pollen. Saeng felt a shock of recognition so intense, it was almost visceral.1 \u201cSaebba,\u201d Saeng whispered. A saebba hedge, tall and lush, had surrounded their garden, its lush green leaves dotted with vermilion flowers. And sometimes after a monsoon rain, a blossom or two would have blown into the well, so that when she drew the well water, she would find a red blossom floating in the bucket. Slowly, Saeng walked down the narrow aisle toward the hibiscus. Orchids, lanna bushes, oleanders, elephant ear begonias, and bougainvillea vines surrounded her. Plants that she had not even realized she had known but had forgotten drew her back into her childhood world. When she got to the hibiscus, she reached out and touched a petal gently. It felt smooth and cool, with a hint of velvet toward the center\u2014just as she had known it would feel. And beside it was yet another old friend, a small shrub with waxy leaves and dainty flowers with purplish petals and white centers. \u201cMadagascar periwinkle,\u201d its tag announced. How strange to see it in a pot, Saeng thought. Back home it just grew wild, jutting out from the cracks in brick walls or between tiled roofs. And that rich, sweet scent\u2014that was familiar, too. Saeng scanned the greenery around her and found a tall, gangly plant with exquisite little white blossoms on it.  \u201cDok Malik,\u201d she said, savoring the feel of the word on her tongue, even as she silently noted the English name on its tag, \u201cjasmine.\u201d One of the blossoms had fallen off, and carefully Saeng picked it up and smelled it. She closed her eyes and breathed in, deeply. The familiar fragrance filled her lungs, and Saeng could almost feel the light strands of her grandmother\u2019s long gray hair, freshly washed, as she combed it out with the fine-toothed buffalo-horn comb. And when the sun had dried it, Saeng would help the gnarled old fingers knot the hair into a bun, then slip a dok Malik bud into it. Saeng looked at the white bud in her hand now, small and fragile. Gently, she closed her palm around it and held it tight. That, at least, she could hold on to. But where was the fine-toothed comb? The hibiscus hedge? The well? Her gentle grandmother? A wave of loss so deep and strong that it stung Saeng\u2019s eyes now swept over her. A blink, a channel switch, a boat ride into the night, and it was all gone. Irretrievably, irrevocably gone.And in the warm moist shelter of the greenhouse, Saeng broke down and wept. It was already dusk when Saeng reached home. The wind was blowing harder, tearing off the last remnants of green in the chicory weeds that were growing out of the cracks in the sidewalk. As if oblivious to the cold, her mother was still out in the vegetable garden, digging up the last of the onions with a rusty trowel. She did not see Saeng until the girl had quietly knelt down next to her. Her smile of welcome warmed Saeng. \u201cGhup ma laio le?

You know how much we\u2014\u201d She paused, as she noticed the tearstains on her daughter\u2019s cheeks and her puffy eyes. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d she asked, more gently. \u201cI\u2014I failed the test,\u201d Saeng said. For a long moment Mrs. Panouvong said nothing. Saeng did not dare look her mother in the eye. Instead, she stared at the hibiscus plant and nervously tore off a leaf, shredding it to bits. Her mother reached out and brushed the fragments of green off Saeng\u2019s hands. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful plant, this dok faeng-noi,\u201d she finally said. \u201cI\u2019m glad you got it.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s\u2014it\u2019s not a real one,\u201d Saeng mumbled. \u201cI mean, not like the kind we had at\u2014at\u2014\u201d She found that she was still too shaky to say the words at home, lest she burst into tears again. \u201cNot like the kind we had before,\u201d she said. \u201cI know,\u201d her mother said quietly. \u201cI\u2019ve seen this kind blooming along the lake. Its flowers aren\u2019t as pretty, but it\u2019s strong enough to make it through the cold months here, this winter hibiscus. That\u2019s what matters.\u201d She tipped the pot and deftly eased the ball of soil out, balancing the rest of the plant in her other hand. \u201cLook how root-bound it is, poor thing,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s plant it, right now.\u201d She went over to the corner of the vegetable patch and started to dig a hole in the ground. The soil was cold and hard, and she had trouble thrusting the shovel into it. Wisps of her gray hair trailed out in the breeze, and her slight frown deepened the wrinkles around her eyes. There was a frail, wiry beauty to her that touched Saeng deeply. \u201cHere, let me help, Mother,\u201d she offered, getting up and taking the shovel away from her. Mrs. Panouvong made no resistance. \u201cI\u2019ll bring in the hot peppers and bitter melons, then, and start dinner. How would you like an omelet with slices of the bitter melon?\u201d \u201cI\u2019d love it,\u201d Saeng said. Left alone in the garden, Saeng dug out a hole and carefully lowered the \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d into it. She could hear the sounds of cooking from the kitchen now, the beating of eggs against a bowl, the sizzle of hot oil in the pan. The pungent smell of bitter melon wafted out, and Saeng\u2019s mouth watered. It was a cultivated taste, she had discovered\u2014none of her classmates or friends, not even Mrs. Lambert, liked it\u2014this sharp, bitter melon that left a golden aftertaste on the tongue. But she had grown up eating it and, she admitted to herself, much preferred it to a Big Mac. The \u201cwinter hibiscus\u201d was in the ground now, and Saeng tamped down the soil around it. Overhead, a flock of Canada geese flew by, their faint honks clear and\u2014yes\u2014familiar to Saeng now. Almost reluctantly, she realized that many of the things that she had thought of as strange before had become, through the quiet repetition of season upon season, almost familiar to her now. Like the geese. She lifted her head and watched as their distinctive V was etched against the evening sky, slowly fading into the distance.

Throughout the story, Saeng experiences a deep sense of loss and displacement as she navigates her new life in the United States. The familiar plants at the florist shop evoke memories of her childhood and homeland in Vietnam. However, Saeng's encounter with the hibiscus and her mother's reassurance about its ability to survive the winter symbolizes resilience and adaptation.\n\nOne example of Saeng's resilience is her decision to purchase the hibiscus despite the steep price. This act highlights her determination to hold onto a piece of her past and create a sense of familiarity in her new surroundings. Additionally, Saeng's decision to plant the hibiscus in her family's garden demonstrates her willingness to adapt and find beauty in her current situation. The planting of the hibiscus can be seen as a metaphor for Saeng's own growth and ability to find strength amidst change and difficulty.\n\nFurthermore, Saeng's vow to retake her driver's test in the spring reflects her resilience and refusal to be defeated by her failures. The mention of the returning geese and the budding hibiscus in the spring symbolizes renewal and the opportunity for a fresh start. Saeng's decision to wait until the arrival of spring conveys her determination to give herself time to adjust and gather strength before attempting the test again.\n\nOverall, the author concludes the story with this paragraph to emphasize Saeng's resilience, hope, and ability to navigate the challenges of her new life. The mention of spring and the promise of the geese returning and the hibiscus blooming symbolize the cyclical nature of life and the possibility for new beginnings. By ending the story on a note of hope, the author leaves the reader with a sense of optimism and the belief that Saeng will continue to overcome obstacles and find her place in this new world."}, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1956, "completion_tokens": 440, "total_tokens": 2396}}]

Respond it to the best of your ability: Read this source essay: FORGET THAT OLD SAYING ABOUT NEVER taking candy from strangers. No, a better piece of advice for the solo cyclist would be, \u201cNever accept travel advice from a collection of old-timers who haven't left the confines of their porches since Carter was in office.\u201d It's not that a group of old guys doesn't know the terrain. With age comes wisdom and all that, but the world is a fluid place. Things change. At a reservoir campground outside of Lodi, California, I enjoyed the serenity of an early-summer evening and some lively conversation with these old codgers. What I shouldn't have done was let them have a peek at my map. Like a foolish youth, the next morning I followed their advice and launched out at first light along a \u201cshortcut\u201d that was to slice away hours from my ride to Yosemite National Park. They'd sounded so sure of themselves when pointing out landmarks and spouting off towns I would come to along this breezy jaunt. Things began well enough. I rode into the morning with strong legs and a smile on my face. About forty miles into the pedal, I arrived at the first \u201ctown.\u201d This place might have been a thriving little spot at one time\u2014say, before the last world war\u2014but on that morning it fit the traditional definition of a ghost town. I chuckled, checked my water supply, and moved on. The sun was beginning to beat down, but I barely noticed it. The cool pines and rushing rivers of Yosemite had my name written all over them. Twenty miles up the road, I came to a fork of sorts. One ramshackle shed, several rusty pumps, and a corral that couldn't hold in the lamest mule greeted me. This sight was troubling. I had been hitting my water bottles pretty regularly, and I was traveling through the high deserts of California in June. I got down on my hands and knees, working the handle of the rusted water pump with all my strength. A tarlike substance oozed out, followed by brackish water feeling somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred degrees. I pumped that handle for several minutes, but the water wouldn't cool down. It didn't matter. When I tried a drop or two, it had the flavor of battery acid. The old guys had sworn the next town was only eighteen miles down the road. I could make that! I would conserve my water and go inward for an hour or so\u2014a test of my inner spirit. Not two miles into this next section of the ride, I noticed the terrain changing. Flat road was replaced by short, rolling hills. After I had crested the first few of these, a large highway sign jumped out at me. It read: ROUGH ROAD AHEAD: DO NOT EXCEED POSTED SPEED LIMIT. The speed limit was 55 mph. I was doing a water-depleting 12 mph. Sometimes life can feel so cruel. I toiled on. At some point, tumbleweeds crossed my path and a ridiculously large snake\u2014it really did look like a diamondback\u2014blocked the majority of the pavement in front of me. I eased past, trying to keep my balance in my dehydrated state. The water bottles contained only a few tantalizing sips. Wide rings of dried sweat circled my sirt, and the growing realization that I could drop from heatstroke on a gorgeous day in June simply because I listened to some gentlemen who hadn't been off their porch in decades, caused me to laugh. It was a sad, hopeless laugh, mind you, but at least I still had the energy to feel sorry for myself. There was no one in sight, not a building, car, or structure of any kind. I began breaking the ride down into distances I could see on the horizon, telling myself that if I could make it that far, I'd be fine.Over one long, crippling hill, a building came into view. I wiped the sweat from my eyes to make sure it wasn't a mirage, and tried not to get too excited. With what I believed was my last burst of energy, I maneuvered down the hill. In an ironic twist that should please all sadists reading this, the building\u2014abandoned years earlier, by the looks of it\u2014had been a Welch's Grape Juice factory and bottling plant. A sandblasted picture of a young boy pouring a refreshing glass of juice into his mouth could still be seen. I hung my head. That smoky blues tune \u201cSummertime\u201d rattled around in the dry honeycombs of my deteriorating brain. I got back on the bike, but not before I gathered up a few pebbles and stuck them in my mouth. I'd read once that sucking on stones helps take your mind off thirst by allowing what spit you have left to circulate. With any luck I'd hit a bump and lodge one in my throat. It didn't really matter. I was going to die and the birds would pick me clean, leaving only some expensive outdoor gear and a diary with the last entry in praise of old men, their wisdom, and their keen sense of direction. I made a mental note to change that paragraph if it looked like I was going to lose consciousness for the last time. Somehow, I climbed away from the abandoned factory of juices and dreams, slowly gaining elevation while losing hope. Then, as easily as rounding a bend, my troubles, thirst, and fear were all behind me. GARY AND WILBER\u2019S FISH CAMP\u2014IF YOU WANT BAIT FOR THE BIG ONES, WE'RE YOUR BEST BET! And the only bet,\u201d I remember thinking. As I stumbled into a rather modern bathroom and drank deeply from the sink, I had an overwhelming urge to seek out Gary and Wilber, kiss them, and buy some bait\u2014any bait, even though I didn't own a rod or reel. An old guy sitting in a chair under some shade nodded in my direction. Cool water dripped from my head as I slumped against the wall beside him. \u201cWhere you headed in such a hurry?\u201d \u201cYosemite,\u201d I whispered. \u201cKnow the best way to get there?\u201d I watched him from the corner of my eye for a long moment. He was even older than the group I'd listened to in Lodi. \u201cYes, sir! I own a very good map.\u201d And I promised myself right then that I'd always stick to it in the future.

The author's decision to trust the advice of the \"old-timers\" and their misleading travel advice leads to a series of unfortunate events that test the cyclist's physical and mental endurance.\n\nFirstly, the author describes the serene reservoir campground outside Lodi, California, where they initially engage in conversation with the old codgers. This peaceful and calm setting sets up a false sense of security and trust. The author, in a moment of foolishness, shares their map with the old men, allowing them to steer the cyclist in the wrong direction. The initially tranquil and enjoyable environment becomes the catalyst for the cyclist's later struggles and challenges.\n\nThe author's journey takes them through desolate and unforgiving landscapes, with abandoned ghost towns and dilapidated structures. The essay mentions a rusty water pump that produces undrinkable water, forcing the cyclist to conserve their dwindling water supply. This scarcity of vital resources intensifies the cyclist's physical and mental hardships, causing them to question their decision to trust the old men's advice.\n\nAdditionally, the essay describes the harsh terrain and challenging road conditions the cyclist encounters. The mention of a \"ROUGH ROAD AHEAD\" sign and the presence of tumbleweeds and a large snake symbolize the cyclist's increasing isolation and vulnerability. The grueling uphill climbs and the absence of any signs of civilization further heighten the cyclist's desperation and sense of being stranded in an inhospitable environment.\n\nThe essay also highlights the oppressively hot weather in the high deserts of California in June. The sun's scorching heat, combined with the cyclist's dehydration due to the lack of drinkable water, becomes a significant physical obstacle. The author's description of their \"dehydrated state\" and the realization that they could succumb to heatstroke underscores the dire consequences of relying on inaccurate advice.\n\nTowards the end of the essay, the cyclist stumbles upon Gary and Wilber's Fish Camp, a ray of hope in an otherwise hopeless situation. The presence of a modern bathroom and access to drinkable water signifies a moment of relief and salvation for the cyclist.
