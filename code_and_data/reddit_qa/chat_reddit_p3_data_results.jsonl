They don't ask you nicely if they can have it, instead, they try to get it without your permission. This is called a hostile takeover.\n\nIn the grown-up world, companies can be like toys. If one company really wants to take control of another company, they can do it in a hostile takeover. They try to get the ownership of the company without the agreement or permission of the people who currently own it.\n\nNow, the 5% rule is a little different. When you buy a big packet of cookies, the company that makes them could have millions of cookies in total. Sometimes, if you want to take control of that cookie company, you don't need to buy all the cookies. You just need to buy a small percentage, like 5% of all the cookies. Once you have 5%, you can start making decisions about the cookie company and try to persuade more people to join your side.\n\nSo, in simple terms, a hostile takeover is when one company tries to forcefully take control of another company.

Concerns over human rights: Some people worry that by engaging with Cuba, the United States may be seen as accepting or ignoring the human rights issues in the country.\n2. Disputes over property and compensation: After the Cuban revolution, some U.S. properties were nationalized and American citizens were not compensated. This issue remains unresolved, and some argue that reestablishing diplomatic relations without resolving it is unfair.\n3.

They might stop spending money, which means there is less money flowing around. This can make businesses struggle, because they rely on people buying their products and services.

These worries actually affect how they behave and can impact the economy.\n\nIf they were not scared and didn't change their behavior, things could be different.
