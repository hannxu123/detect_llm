Despite its promising name, these scrubs are anything but comfortable.\n\nFirst and foremost, the fit is completely off. I ordered my usual size, but these pants were strangely tight around the waist and hips, while being too long in length. This made it incredibly difficult to move around comfortably while wearing them. The design of the pant is also unflattering and does not do justice to the female body shape.\n\nNot only is the fit disappointing, but the material is also subpar. These scrubs are made from a rough and stiff fabric that feels cheap and uncomfortable against the skin. It did not provide any stretch or flexibility, making it difficult to bend or squat during my work shifts. It felt like I was wearing a plastic bag rather than a comfortable pair of scrubs.\n\nTo make matters worse, the quality of construction leaves much to be desired. After just a few wears and washes, I noticed that the seams were already coming apart. This is unacceptable, especially considering the price I paid for these scrubs. I expected much better durability from a well-established brand like Jockey.\n\nI regret my purchase of the Jockey Scrubs Women's Maximum Comfort Pant and would not recommend it to anyone seeking comfortable and well-fitting scrubs.
