Sin^2(x) is equal to (sin(x))^2, which means you are squaring the value of sin(x). When you take the derivative of sin^2(x), it involves a concept called the chain rule in calculus. The chain rule states that when you have a function inside another function (like taking the square of sin(x)), you need to multiply the derivative of the outer function by the derivative of the inner function. That's why the derivative of sin^2(x) is 2sin(x)cos(x) -- it takes into account both the derivative of sin(x) and cos(x).\n\nSimilarly, when you integrate (or find the antiderivative) of x, you get x^2/2, which represents the area under the line. But for sin(x) and cos(x), their derivatives are cyclical functions, meaning they repeat themselves after a certain interval. As a result, their antiderivatives do not have simple algebraic expressions like x^2/2. Instead, they involve special functions like the sine integral or the cosine integral.

A slow shutter speed keeps the eye open longer, like when you blink slowly to capture something blurred or with motion.\n\n2. Aperture: Think of the aperture as the eye's pupil.

It controls its sensitivity to light. Lower ISO (e.g., 100) is good for bright places, and higher ISO (e.g., 1600) is useful in darker places.
